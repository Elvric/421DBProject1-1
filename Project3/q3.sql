/*
1) Index on the specialization attribute of the HealthPractitioners relation:
Indexing on specializations is useful for finding how frequent a specific drug is prescribed by medical specializations (e.g. cardiology).
Queries to find the most and least prescribed drugs are used to alter and optimize insurance plans. 
For example, if a new dermatology drug is released and a lot of dermatologists are prescribing it, 
then it should be included in the offered insurance plans.

/*
2) Index on the manufacturer attribute of the Drugs relation:
Indexing on manufacturer is useful to categorize manufacturers into generic drug manufacturers and brand-name drug manufacturers.
When the client buys a prescribed drug, the drug sold to the client by the pharmacist could be made by different manufacturers.
This is important to the insurance company so that different coverages can be optimized and offered to the clients. 
The clients also need to know about the difference in the coverage of a generic drug versus a brand-name drug.
